The purpose of the project was to create a compiler that was able to, ofcourse, compile code. Specificaly KnightCode through the use of Java, Java ASM, and ANTLR. Team members for the project include Jacob Morris and Aaron Bone. The compiler will take in a Knight Code grammar file and .kc files for testing. Then the compiler will require the use of a build.xml file to prepare the commands for ANTLR to function. The following ant commands are used, in order, to create the lexer and parses: build-grammar, compile-grammar, and compile. With the compiler being compiled and ready to function due to the ant commands, testing can begin by first compiling the test files via commands such as java compiler/kcc tests/program1.kc output/output1. This is java running the compiler to compile the kc file. Then to run the kc code, do java output/output1.
